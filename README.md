1) AI-Learning-Projectss

  > A collection of AI practice projects to learn Git, GitHub workflows, and experiment with basic machine learning models.

 2) Project Structure

   >hello_ai.py â†’ First demo script (prints "Hello, AI World!")

   >preprocessing/preprocess.py â†’ Data loading and cleaning using pandas

   >eda.py â†’ Exploratory Data Analysis (summary statistics + histograms)

   >model.py â†’ Logistic Regression model experiments

  3) Git & GitHub Workflow

   > Used Git branches for different tasks (data-preprocessing, feature/eda, experiment-v1, experiment-v2)

   > Practiced commits, merges, and conflict resolution

   > Added tags & releases for experiment tracking
